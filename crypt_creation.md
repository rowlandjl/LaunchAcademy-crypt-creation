Remember when we talked about the Crypt of Civilization a few weeks ago? Now
you're going to turn the time capsule into Ruby code!

Here is a link to an article about it:
[Crypt of Civilization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypt_of_Civilization)

Write a line of code that initializes an empty array called
`crypt_of_civilization`

{% show_solution %}
```ruby
crypt_of_civilization = Array.new
```

or

```ruby
crypt_of_civilization = []
```
{% endshow_solution %}
